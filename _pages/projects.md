- **Multivarite Time Series Classification with Random Forest:** Currently extending random forests with structured projection matrices for applications in EEG signal classification problems related to decision making and anatomical classification. (Results to come!)

- **Tetris AI:** Developed a Deep Q-Network using the deep reinforcement learning framework implemented using Python and TensorFlow.
([View project on Github](https://github.com/ChesterHuynh/tetrisAI))

- **Semi-Automatic Localization of Stereo-EEG Contacts:** Developed an algorithm to segment contacts from CT images of epilepsy patients to streamline the coregistration process. ([View project on Github](https://github.com/adam2392/neuroimg_pipeline))

- **Tri-Tag:** A modern, digital approach to Triage. My group received a Top Ten in Category award out of hundreds of participandts at MedHacks 2018. TriTag is an efficient patient marker and tracking system for patients in Emergency and Mass Casualty events. It consists of three steps: (1) Initial assessment and assignment of severity and hash code, (2) HIPAA-compliant cloud database of important medical data for remote retrieval, and (3) ambulatory tracking of patients through cloud database.
