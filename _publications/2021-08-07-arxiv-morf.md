This article proposes a manifold-aware variant on decision forests for structured data called manifold oblique random forest (MORF), which outperforms convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the low-sample regime for certain image and time series classification tasks. In this study, I contributed results of MORF on the multivariate time series in the context of motor decoding from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) data.
