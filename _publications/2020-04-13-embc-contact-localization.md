This conference paper was accepted at [EMBC 2020](https://embc.embs.org/2020/). It outlines the algorithm implemented in Python for semi-automatically localizing and labeling SEEG depth electrodes in 3D images of brain volumes. Fully automating this task is left to future work.

The pipeline is available for viewing under [Github](https://github.com/ncsl/seek).
