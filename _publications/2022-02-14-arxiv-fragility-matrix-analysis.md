This paper provides supplemental analysis on rank-one perturbation matrices in linear dynamical systems. This extends on the model of neural fragility for localizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which can be modeled as a dynamical system. My contributions were largely in the theoretical analysis, leverging theory from matrix analysis.
