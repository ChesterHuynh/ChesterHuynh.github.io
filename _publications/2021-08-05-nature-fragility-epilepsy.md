This retrospective study aims to predict surgical outcomes of epilepsy patients using a new electroencephalography (EEG) marker called **neural fragility**. My contribution to this study was developing a manifold-aware variant of random forest algorithm for multivariate time series data that was used to predict surgical outcome using neural fragility data.
